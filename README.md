# DSND-Recommendations_with_IBM

This is a simple project to demonstrate basic approaches in a recommendation system that recommends 
articles for reading to users. All of the implementation code is located in the jupyter notebook for the project. 

##  Project Files

*  *Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb*   -- Notebook implementing recommendation techniques
*  *Recommendations_with_IBM.html*    -- HTML print of the notebook
*  *project_tests.py*                 -- Tests of the code based on known results

## Project Techniques 

*  *Rank based* -- Return most popular articles based on user interaction
*  *User-user based* -- Return articles based on similarity to other users in terms of article interactions
*  *Content Based*  -- Return articles that are similar in content to other articles read by the user. This 
    is a little more involved and requires some Natural Language Processing.
*  *Matrix Factorization* -- This section involves matrix factorization, and matrix factorization can
    certainly be important in recommendation systems, but it does not demonstrate viable usage here.
